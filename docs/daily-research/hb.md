## Definition:(from wikipedia)

  Docker is a set of platform as a service(PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

  Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software,libraries and configuration files.The containers use fewer resources than virtual machines.

  The software thar hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.

## Operation:(from wikipedia)

  Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer.

  Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously.

  Docker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation.

## Components:(from wikipedia)

  The Docker software as a service offering consists of three components:
  
  **software & objects & registries**
